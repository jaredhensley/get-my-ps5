## FAQ

### Does this thing actually work?

As of Tuesday, December 8, 2020, I've received confirmation that this bot works:

With that being said, this is a simple bot. It checks for a redirect, and then opens your web browser. 
* You should make sure you're already logged in with a PSN ID.
* You'll still need to complete reCAPTCHA on Sony's website.
* There's still a solid chance you _won't_ get a PS5.

However, I believe this utility will give most people a leg up, because they don't have to rely on a third-party service (such as NowInStock.net) to send you a notification that PS5s are in stock. You're running it directly from your computer, which removes a lot of overhead and (hopefully) gives you an advantage.

Good luck!

### How does this work?

This works by hitting Sony PlayStation Direct store every 5 seconds, and checking for a redirect that indicates a queue is forming. As soon as the queue starts forming, it will open your browser and you'll be placed within the queue.

The previous version attempted to add the PlayStation 5 console directly to the cart. Unfortunately, the API endpoint it was using for this didn't return a successful response even when PS5s were in stock, rendering it useless. So I changed it.

### I'm not familiar with CLI and software. How do I install and get this running?

1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).
1. Download this utility by clicking the green "Code" button above, and then click "Download ZIP."
1. Unzip the contents.
1. Next you'll need to open a CLI instance at the `get-my-ps5-master` folder:
    * Windows users: open the folder, type `cmd` in the address bar, and hit enter. [Still need help?](https://www.itechtics.com/open-command-window-folder/#:~:text=You%20can%20open%20a%20command,be%20opened%20in%20the%20folder.)
    * Mac users: right click the folder and select "New terminal at folder."
1. Once you have the CLI instance open at the `get-my-ps5-master` folder, enter each command, then press enter:
    * `npm install`
    * `npm run watch`
1. Choose which console you prefer (disc or digital), and the search will begin.
1. Let it do it's thing. It will open your browser as soon as it detects a queue forming.

### How do I stop this from running?

Enter `Control + C` in your Terminal window, or exit the Terminal altogether.
